## Challenge Description

> I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out! Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Initial Analysis

### What we know:
I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website here!

### Tools Used:

- [Burp Suit] - Capture and intercept Requests

## Reconnaissance
This challenge gives us a URL to a simple website. On the homepage, there’s only one input field where we can type something. When we click the “Ok” button, the page redirects and displays whatever we typed.

My first step was to inspect the Network and Elements tabs in the browser developer tools. I was looking for clues or anything strange, but nothing stood out.

### Step 1: Initial Inspection

1. Source code inspection revealed a ROT 13 cipher
